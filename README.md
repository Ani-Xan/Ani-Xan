### Hi there 👋 I'm devxan 
But you ~~can~~ **SHOULD** me Xan. 
- 👍 You should check out my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/devxan).
- 🔭 I work on animations on [Scratch](https://Scrach.mit.edu/users/-Xanimation-/)!
- 🌱 I use the prototyping tool [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) as my graphic design platform, even though it's for prototyping. 
- 🤔 I don't know a lot about coding in general, but I use the block code language [Scratch](https://Scrach.mit.edu/), which is based off of google's "[Blocky](https://developers.google.com/blockly)"
- 😄 Pronouns: He/His
- 🎉 Check out [ScratchAddons](https://scratchaddons.com/), the best extension ever for the Scratch website. ([I helped](https://scratchaddons.com/contributors)!)
